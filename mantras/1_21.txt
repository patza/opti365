Positivity is not naive. Positivity is necessary. Many believe possessing a positive attitude during difficult times is a sign of idealism. Being positive doesn't mean you're naive or indiferrent or impractical; being positive means you have the strength to stand up to a negative situation, to courageously refute negativity and the embrace the good in what's happening now (even if that now seems pretty rough).

Go through your possessions (and I do mean all of them) and get rid of the things you don't need or want. Give it away if you can. If you can't, throw it away. You can do it. Don't waste another second. Don't weigh the pros and cons of keeping it or not. If you don't need it, don't use ut, and don't love it, get rid of it. All the things you have but don't need stand in the way of productivity.

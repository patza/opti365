What you love-- and don't love-- about others can show you a lot about who you are and what you value. Consider the people you are closest to. What do you love most about them ? What don't you like so much ? Why ? Instead of simply interacting with those you see on a daily basis, spend some time thinking about what attributes about those people appeal to you. Being aware of these traits can hel you have a better understanding of your relationships.

Do something today that scares you. Push yourself just a little bit further than you thought you could go. You, like all of us, tend to get settled into what you're used to. When you reach out and do something new-- something a little bit scary-- you'll find yourself inspired and invigorated. Everything that once was mundane will sparkle with just a little bit of magic.

Little bits of negativity will creep into your mind from time to time. And you know what ? That's okay. Being positive doesn't mean being positive every second of every day. it means making the most of a situation to the best of your ability abd trying to see the good, even when that's very difficult to do. Positivity isn't perfect. Positivity is always a work in progress.

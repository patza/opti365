Sometimes beauty comes in the absence of something else. The absence of noise can be beautiful. So can the absence of pain or regret. Look around for negative feelings, situations, or people that are currently missing from your life and observe the beauty of their absence. Note how beautiful it feels to be without the things that bring you down.

Beauty should not be caged or chained. It should be allowed to change and shift. Free your mind to the idea that beauty can take different shapes. Time will change what you think is beautiful-- or how you think it's beautiful. Let beauty do its thing. Let the beautiful things in your life become what they need to become. Accept then for what they were, what they are, and what they will be.

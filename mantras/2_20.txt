As people change and grow, relationships can become strained if one person (or both people) changes. If you want to maintain a relationship over a long period of time, you must be open to new experiences and perspectives. At his or her core, the person you are in relationship with is the same. Strive to be open-minded when he or she seems to change-- and encourage him or her to do the same for you should you change over the course of the relationship.

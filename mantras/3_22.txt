The source of inspiration does not matter. Do not swayed by what you think you "should" be inspired by. Inspiration can-- and  does-- come from anywhere and everywhere. What inspires you might not inspire someone else. What everyone else finds inspiring might not spark inspiration in you. Accept that inspiration is unique and allow yourself to be inspired by whatever moves you.

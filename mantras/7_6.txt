You don't need fancy organizing bins or carefully selected day planners to be productive. You can use what you have and make it work for you. Everything around you has the ability to be put in order, to be organized to suit your needs. Don't make excuses by saying you don't have the right tools or equipment. What you think you need, you don't. What you truly need, you have.

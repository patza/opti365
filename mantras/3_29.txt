What do you think when you first open your eyes every morning ? Are you thrilled-- or at least a little bit interested-- by the prospects of the day ? You should be. Each day has something to offer (even if you don't always recognize what that is until much later). If your initial thoughts each day aren't inspired, post a reminder to yourself on your phone or bedside wall to spark inspiration.

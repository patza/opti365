Positivity takes practices. Like anything worth doing, it does'nt come easily. You will have to work on it constantly-- and the more you work, the better you'll become at pointing out positive aspects of any situation. Encourage yourself to be optimistic-- even if it might seem forced at times--and, much to your surprise (and delight!), you will actually become optimistic.

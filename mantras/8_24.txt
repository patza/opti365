Beauty cannot always be put into words or explained clearly. Don't waste time trying to fit beauty into a box, to label it. Accept it for what it is. Words may not do it justice, but he way you feel about something beautifull will serve it weel. Allow yourself yo go without words, to spend time soaking up the beauty around you without trying to define it.

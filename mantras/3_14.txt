To be truly inspired, you must spark inspiration in others. To put your own dreams in motion, it helps to propel someone else's wishes. Inspiring others-- either through a kind act, a thoughtful comment, or a grand gesture-- will further inspire you as well. It is a win-win of inspiration and motivation.

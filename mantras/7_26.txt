Today is No More Excuses Day. It's time to drop whatever excuses you've been using to put off productivity-- too tired, too busy, too stressed-- and simply get to work. No more excuses. No more reasons why you can't do what you really want to do. The only thing standing in your way is you. Break through your own excuses and you'll find what you want deep down : progress.

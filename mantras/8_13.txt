How do you define beauty ? Ask yourself what you consider to be beautiful and why-- and then dig deeper. Is there a way to create more beauty in your life by expanding that definition of beauty ? Have you restricted yourself by believing in a limited definition of what is beautiful ? If so, consider how you can expand how you define beauty to include so much more. Remember: beauty is everywhere and in everything.

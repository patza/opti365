Assess the pros and cons of your actions. What might feel productive might not actually be. Make sure you know not only what you're doing., but also why you're doing it. Don't let yourself get settled in your routines (no matter how productive they seem) simply because they appear to be working. Always saty open to new ways of doing things. Always be ready to reevalute what's working and what's not.

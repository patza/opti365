Good relationships are like gravity. They bring you down to earth-- abd they are so stabilizing that they're often completely forgotten. Do not forget how valuable a good relationship is. Treasure it and make time for it. Pull yourself out of your work, your thoughts, and look around you. Ask yourself what relationships you've been taking for granted, what relationships could use a little extra TLC, and what relationships are no longer positive forces in your life.

Every single day, every single second, you have a choice : you can assume a positive attitude or you can assume a negative one. And, amazingly, every moment is a chance to start again. If you didn't wake up in the best mood, do not be disheartened. You can start again right now. Your attitude is always open to alterations. Nip and tuck whenever necessary. Tailor your thoughts to be positive.

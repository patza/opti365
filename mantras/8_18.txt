Love is beautiful. It is one of the most beautiful things there is. Celebrate the love in your life, the love of your life. Celebrate all the love you've experienced-- and all the love you will experience in the future. Look at the ones you love abd remind yourself of all the beauty you see in them. Beautiful are those who love-- but those who celebrate love are drop-dead gorgeous.

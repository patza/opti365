Don't be afraid of delegation. Even if you like to be in control, one way to keep things productive is to delegate tasks yo others. No matter how skilled you are you can't do everything. And you'll be surprised how many people will be happy to help. If you aren't up for a task-- or don't think you can do it well-- delegate. Delegation can be a productivity lifesaver.

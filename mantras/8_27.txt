beauty doesn't have to have a purpose. Beauty can be just for its own sake. If you must find a reason to seek beauty, remind yourself that the act of looking for the good in life is reason enough. The smile something beautiful brings to your face, the moment you inhale sharply when you spot something beautiful, and the joy that comes with creating beauty are, in themselves, filled with dazzling intention.

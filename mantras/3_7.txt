You deserve to have everything you want. You deserve the things you truly desire (even those dhings you tell no one about). Believe that and you will find ways to turn dreams into realities. Sometimes your dreams won't come true in the same way you imagined them, but if you go after what you wa and believe you deserve it-- you will succeed.

Beauty comes when you get not what you want, but what you need. What do you have in your life that you need ? What fulfills you ? What could you not live without ? Today rejoice in the needs that are met, the beauty that comes with having what you need (even if you're without everything you want). Recognizing needs met is a beautiful thing. Gratitude is gorgeous.

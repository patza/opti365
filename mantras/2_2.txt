Emotions have a ripple effect on relationships. Your emotional state can impact those around you, and the emotional states of others can impact you. Consider how you let your emotions infiltrate your relationships and ponder wheter or not you are surrounding yourself with positive emotions. Also, do not forget that those you spend time with greatly impact your emotional state. Choose your friend wisely.

Even sadness possesses beauty. There is beauty even in the hardest times. Rather than rejecting negative emotions, embrace and explore them. Look for the beauty in feeling something-- even if it is sadness or anger or irritation. Emotions, no matter what they are, are beautiful. Dwell on the positive ones, but don't avoid the negative. Those possess beauty too.

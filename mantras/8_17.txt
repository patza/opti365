Confucius said, "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it". Do you see beauty today ? Are you open to it ? When things are difficult, it will be a struggle to find the beauty. You must stay open to it. You must look for it. Sometimes you have to get your hands dirty. Sometimes you have to dig a little deeper to find beauty beneath the surface.

An expression of gratitude, appreciation, or love can mean so much. The smallest token, the quickest compliment-- even the littlest things can make a difference in another's day. Today tell one person how good she looks, how much you love him, how much she means to you. Love comes in so many shapes and sizes, but there's always enough of it to be shared freely and frequently with those closest to you.

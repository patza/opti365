Being negative gets you nowhere. There is nothing to be gained from looking at the negative side of things. While the positive may, at times, seem idealistic, it forces your brain to think about the world optimistically and increases positive emotions and actions. Thinking negatively, on the other hand, does not. It does nothing good for you, so why do it ?

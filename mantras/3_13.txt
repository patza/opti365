Stop doubting yourself. Stop believing that there might be a reason you cannot achieve what you want to achieve. You can. You will. But only if you rid your mind of doubts. Doubt, if you let it, will eat away at your inspiration until you are left with nothing. Do not allow that to happen. Push doubt aside and just go for it.

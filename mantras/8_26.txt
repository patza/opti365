What's real is beautiful. Look around at this moment. What's happening right now is where beauty lies. Beauty exists not in the past or the future. It is in the now. You may want to recall the beauty you've seen or pine for the beauty you've yet to see. But, instead focus on the beauty of this moment. Zero in the beauty of now.

There is something positive in everything. In every person, in every situation, there is something good. Most of the time it's not obvious. You have to look. And sometimes you have to look hard, really squinting to see that shining glimmer of goodness. But it's always there. Just keep looking. Positive things are all around and if you take the time to look, you will always find what you seek.

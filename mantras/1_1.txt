Cop an attitude. A positive attitude, that is. Your attitude is one of the few things you have total control over. Sometimes life limits your choices, but life never limits what kind of attitude you can select. Choosing a positive attitude will change your life. It will infiltrate every aspect of who you are, what you do, and where you go. You have the power to change what you experience by changing how you think about those experiences.

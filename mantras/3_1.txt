If you could have a dream come true, what would that dream be ? Don't push your dream to the back of your mind, thinking someday ... Don't deny the possibility that your dream could become a reality. If you want to live your most positive, most present life, you cannot deny your dreams. You cannot look at them like caged birds, something pretty behind bars. Instead, you must see them as something that should be set free.

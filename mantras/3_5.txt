You need to understand where you're going and why. You've chosen this path, but why ? Why are you going in this direction ? What does the path of your life look like ? What's behind you ? What's on front of you ? Every day you make a choice to stay in this path. You could turn down another street or veer wildly into the grassy field beside the road. But you don't. Why ? Understanding the path is very important to knowing who you are (and who you want to be).

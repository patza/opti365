Whatch out for self-sabotage, for those moments you tell yourself that you're being productive even when you know that's just not true. Don't allow for the rationalization of laziness. Relaxation is imperative for living a positive life; laziness is not. Ask yourself, "Am I being lazy or am I just relaxing ?" When you relax, you're taking a break. When you're lazy, you're missing out on potential breakthroughts.

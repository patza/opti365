Sometimes it's difficult deal with others' behaviors and it can be more difficult to separate yourself from these behaviors. Sometimes you may feel so close to a person that you consider him or her to be part of who you are-- but other people do not make up who you are. Who you have relationships with is not who you are. You are your own person with your own identity. You are connected to others, but never forget that you are an individual.

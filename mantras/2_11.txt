Remain open-minded when listening to others. Don't jump in with your comments too soon. Good listening skills are essential to positive relationshipts, but listening patiently doesn't always come easily. Resolve to give others your full attention when they are speaking. Do not allow your mind to wander to what you want to say next. Focus on the words (and body language) of those who are speaking.

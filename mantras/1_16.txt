Optimism is not a form of denial. Positivity does not mean pushing away anything that doesn't make you happy. Instead, it is the belief that there is always a silver lining. It is the knowledge that, no matter how bad things might seem, there is something good amidst the pain and heartbreak and unhappiness. Positivity is courageous. It is brave. Do not let others tell you otherwise.

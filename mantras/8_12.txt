Do not allow others to steal beauty from you with their negative comments or actions. Choose to think for yourself-- to view life through your own picturesque lens. When you find the beauty in something, don't allow that beauty to be refuted. Let others think what they want about beauty, but don't allow them to steal what you believe is beautiful from you.

Positivity often gets a bad rap, with positive people discredited and labeled "Pollyannaish". Be open to having a positive attitude. Positivity is not silly of frivolous, naive or unintelligent. Positivity is a bold choice in the face of the negativity surrounding us. Positivity is a challenge-- but it's one that you're up for.

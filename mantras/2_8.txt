Most relationships contain conflict. But conflict is not necessary a bad thing in moderation. Conflict is a great way to learn more about others. If you pay attention, you will learn not only about another's point of view, but also about the way he or she argues. If you pay close attention, you can pick up a lot of information about others when you actively engage in conflict. Do not shy away from it; strive to engage in conflict positively and productively.

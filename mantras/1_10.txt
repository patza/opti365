Whatever you look for in life, you move toward. The attitude you have when you wake up will permeate your entire day. If you start off with a positive attitude, you'll be more aware of the good things that happen. Likewise, if you start off negatively, you'll be drawn to see the negative things that occur. When you recognize that what you focus on, you mobe toward, you relaize that beginning each day positively is just that much more important for having a good day.

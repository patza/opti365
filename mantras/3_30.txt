Inspiration doesn't come to those who are lazy. It requires work. If you want to be inspired, you have to be inspiring. Show others what you can do-- what you can be-- abd you will find inspiration starts poppong up all around you. To inspire others, you don't have to do anything crazy. Just be you. Everything you are should be inspiration enough.

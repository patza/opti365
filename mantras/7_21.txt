It's time to take a break. Productivity happens when you make time for relaxation. What makes you feel at peace ? What creates a sense of calm ? Make sure to incorporate mini-breaks into your day. And make sure those breaks are truly breaks-- don't just swap one to-do for another. Take a walk. Take a drive. Call a friend. Separate yourself, just for a little while, from that to-do list.

Relationships are often based on things you have in common with someone else. However, common interests aren't always positive. Often people bond over judging or putting down others. If you want to have a lasting, meaningful relationship, focus on positive common bonds that will bring you closer to another person. And be sure to check in on your relationships to make sure they remain based on positive, mutual interests and activities.

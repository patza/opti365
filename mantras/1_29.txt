No matter how tough things are, there is at least one thing going right in this moment. It might be a small thing-- like your ability to still get out of bed in the morningor the sun shining lazily in the sky-- but the size doesn't matter. What matters is that it's there. Instead of focusing on the negative, direct your attention to the things (however small) going right. Make it a game if you must (Spot the Positive Thing), but seek to spot the good things-- even when life's hard.

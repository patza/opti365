They say March goes in like a lion and out like a lamb. Inspiration, too, goes in like a lion and out like a lamb. It is ferocious when you first encounter it-- loud and bold and heart pounding-- but once it has settled within you, it is docile and bleats only occasionally for your attention. Even when it's no longer clamoring for your attention, don't ignore the things that once inspired you. You may have grown, moved away from them. They may have calmed, grown quieter. But they were once wild and thrilling ideas roaring with possibility. Revisit them from time to time. You might be surprised by what you find.

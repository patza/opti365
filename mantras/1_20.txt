Spread positivity with acts of kindness. Acts of kindness shouldn't be random. You shouldn't do them every once and awhile. You should to them all the time. You should treat kindness like it is limitless and free (which it is). The smallest thing -- a smile, a kind word, a door held open -- can spark positivity. It can blaze a fire in someone else that will light up the rest of the day. You have the power to fan these positive flames wherever you go. One kind act if all it takes.

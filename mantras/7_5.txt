Putting things off is a great way to create stress and feel unproductive. Don't procrastinate today. If you can do it today, do it. "I don't feel like it" is not an excuse. Do what you can today because you never know what tomorrow will bring. You don't want to look back and say "I wish I'd done that yesterday".

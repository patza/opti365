For one hour today, turn off your phone. Click out of your email. Take a break from all technology and focus. Direct your attention to whatever tasks ranks highest on your to-do list. Prepare for any potential distractions and avoid things that will keep you from getting done what you need to do. It sounds difficult-- turning off technology-- but one you get into the groove, you'll be so pleased with your progress.

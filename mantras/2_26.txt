The right people will always bring you up, not down. They will always support you. They will never make you feel worthless or insignificant. If you have people in your life who make you feel bad about who you are, get rid of them. Life is too short to waste time on relationships fraught with negativity. Hard as it might be, let them go. You will be surprised by how quickly they are replaced by positive people.

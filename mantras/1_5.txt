Share your wealth of positivity with the world. The best way to do this is quite simple : be nice. Be nice to other people, no matter what. Tell someone she or he looks nice today. Tell someone he or she did a great job on that presentation. Tell your loved ones how great they are. When someone is feeling down, do what you can to cheer him or her up. Send flowers. Write notes. Don't gossip. Be kind to all living things. Share your positivity.

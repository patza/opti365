Draw back the shades. Open the window. Let the beauty of the outside come inside. Let the light shine in and the air circulate through. No matter what the wheather, throw open the windows today and celebrate the beauty of the outdoors allowed in. Consider what other types of beauty you might let in if you only opened up your windows.

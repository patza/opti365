Inspiration is not opposed to routine. In fact, inspiration can become part of your day-to-day activities. You don't have to wait for inspiration to appear each day. You can make it happen by incorporating it into your life on a daily basis. Mark it on your calendar. Plan a date. Set aside time to be inspired.

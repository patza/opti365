It can be very hard not to be dragged down by other's negativity, but you have the power to control your own attitude. No matter what others do or say, you have the ability to choose a positive mindset. You have the capability to shape your world (and possibly theirs) with your own optimistic thoughts and actions. Do not let others drag you down. Instead, strive to lift them up.

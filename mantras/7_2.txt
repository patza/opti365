Today is the day you master the art of the to-do list. Firt and foremost : create the list in a convenient place. Whether it's on your phone, on your computer, or on a piece of paper, choose a place that's easy to access. Next, get a system in place. Put daily to-dos on a list; put monthly tasks on a calendar. Use a system that works for you. Finally, actually use the list you create-- and edit any part of the list-making system that's not working for you.

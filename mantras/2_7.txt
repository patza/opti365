You can improve relationships with others by not caring about what they do. You can both remove yourself from caring about specific actions and still care about the person. Not caring is a great way to improve a difficult relationship with someone you love. By not caring, you can stop trying to change those around you. You can fully accept others for who they are and, as a result, be at peace with the choices they make.

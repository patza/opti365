What are your priorities ? Are you spending time on the things that really matter to you ? Sometimes productivity is aimed in the wrong direction. Make sure the hours and days you spend being productive are focused on the things you desire. Don't be productive doing what you "should" do. Use your productivity for the life you want, the life you deserve.

Color-coding has its benefits. So do labels and lists and filing cabinets. Take advantage of the organizing tools you have at your disposal (some of which are on your computer and are free). If you don't know where to start when it comes to organizing, do a little online search. You'll find endless amounts of resources. The more order you create in your life, the less time you'll waste, and the more productive you'll be.

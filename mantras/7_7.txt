Learn to say "no". If someone asks for your help and you don't have the time or energy, be honest and admit you can't offer your assistance at the moment. It can be hard to turn requests down (especially from those close to you), but the more you pile on your plate, the less productive you'll be-- and the more stressed out you'll become.

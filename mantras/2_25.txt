Your actions impact others. Choose wisely. Do not allow yourself to believe you are acting in isolation. Whatever you choose to do has an impact on many people-- even when it might seem like it only matters to you. When making choices, consider others as well. When it comes to living a positive life, self-love is vital, but selfishness is lethal.

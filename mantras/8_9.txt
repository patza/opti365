Do you see beauty when you look in the mirror ? You should. Everything about you-- even the parts you don't love-- is beautiful. Don't let anyone (or society) tell you anything different. You are beautiful just as you are. Every piece if you fits together just as it should. Make a point to look at yourself today and remind your reflection: "I am beautiful".

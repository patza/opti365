Stop looking for four-leaf clovers. You must create your on luck. Believe you are lucky because you are. You have the power to make your own luck, to create your opportunities, to seek your own adventures. That's true luck. Don't waste time looking around for that rainbow and that pot of gold. Create your own rainbow, your own gold-filled pot of luck.

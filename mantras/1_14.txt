Don't fool yourself into thinking positivity is something you had to be born with. It can be learned. It can also be taught. If your nature isn't inherently positive, don't worry. You can still choose positivity. You may have to work a bit harder than some, but you will get there. Don't give up on yourself. There is a positive force within you-- and it's up to you to dig down deep and access it.

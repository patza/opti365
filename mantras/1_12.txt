Don't let one bad thing ruin your positive attitude. When the bad seems overwhelming and it's taking over your thoughts, pause and think about what positive things can be taken from this bad situation. What else in your life is making you happy ? How much good is there compared to this one bad thing ? Just one bad thing can have a lot of power-- and it can destroy a positive attitude if you let it get the best of you. Don't. Choose to shift your focus and find the good.

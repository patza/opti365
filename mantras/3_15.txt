You were born for this life. You were meant to do this-- whatever it is you are doing. Keep at it. When it's hard, know deep down that it will get better. When it's impossible, find ways to stay inspired. You can seek inspiration outside yourself, but know that you will always connect with it most deeply when you uncover it within your heart and mind.

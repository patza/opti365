There are more than two boxes simply labeled NEGATIVE and POSITIVE. Try to avoid placing anything in a single box. Labels-- even good ones-- tend to limit the way you see the world. When you encounter a negative situation, person or attitude, question it. Ask yourself if there is, beneath the surface, something good. You will often be surprised by the positive attributes you find when you start looking for them.

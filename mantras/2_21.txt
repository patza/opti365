The whole "get what you give" concept is clich√©, yes, but it's also true. If you want to be around a certain types of person, you need to be that type of person. If you don't feel you are the type of person you would want to spend time with, ask yourself "What can I do to make myself the kind of person I want to spend time with ?" When you think about what you wan to see in others, you'll realize what you need to be yourself.

Pay attention to mood. By listening to the tone and speed of someone's voice while noting facial expressions and body language, you can get a good idea of what kind of mood someone is in. If you sense that someone is in negative state, consider giving him or her space-- or asking how you can help. Also pay attention to your own mood when you interact with others; know when you are at your best-- and when it might be best to be alone.

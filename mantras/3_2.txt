Change the "I want" in your life to "I am". You cannot expect to get things you're not giving out. You cannot expect to make real the dreams you are not living. If you want something-- kindness, strength, happiness, whatever-- you have to be it. Every time you find yourself saying "I want ...", remind yourself that you must instead focus on "I am ...". You have to be instead of want.

You only have a limited amount of time in this life, and you should make the most of it. Spend your free time doing what makes you happy, what brings you closer to a dream-come-true. It's easy to get sucked into doing whatother people want to do or justifying activities and saying that you "have" to do them, but do you really ? Spend your time making your own dreams come true.

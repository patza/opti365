Beauty might be in the eye if the beholder, but the beholder will only see it if she has her eyes open. Are you looking for the beauty in your life ? It's there, all around you. It's everywhere. It's in your daily routines. It's in the unexpected celebrations. It's in every season, every morning, and every every night. Beauty isn't always what you think it should be. It's whatever moves you, whatever makes you smile. The trick is not just to simply see beauty, but to actively look for it.

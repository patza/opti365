Positivity isn't simply cheefulness. Cheerfulness can be a cover-up for what's really going on beneath the surface, but positivity is an internal belief that allows you to focus on the good in any situation. Positivity can, but doesn't always, lead to cheerfulness. Cheefulness can be, but isn't always, a sign of a positive outlook. If you want to live a positive life, you must learn not just to be a cheerful person, but also to be a positive one.

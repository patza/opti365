What do you really, truly want from this life ? If you listen to the voice inside you-- the one that really knows what you want and isn't distracted by the doubts and fears created byt the world outside your mind-- you'll find out not what just what you want, but what you need. It's up to you to merge those wants and needs-- to appreciate what your desire and acknowledge what's essential.

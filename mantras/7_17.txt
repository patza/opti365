Do not have a junk drawer/box/room. Ever. Junk drawers (and rooms and closets) are bottomless pits of disorganization. They encourage you to be disorganized by allowing you to have a place to put the things you don't know what to do with. If you come accross something that doesn't have a place, create a place for it. If you don't want to create a place for it, it's junk. Everything should have a place, and things that don't have a place should find a place in the garbage can or the recycling bin.

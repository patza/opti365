Don't allow yourself to dwell in the shallows of over-thinking. Too much analysis holds you back; it sops you from diving in to whatever inspires and excites you. Give your life careful thought-- but don't over do it. If you allow rumination to overtake you, you will always be standing on the sand while those truly inspired are diving enthusiastically into the waves.

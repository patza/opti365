Forget the notion that inspiration will hit you like a ton of bricks or a flash of lightning. It's rarely that way. Instead, inspiration usually creeps in slowly, through the back door, when you're not looking. It will sidle up next to you quietly and pull up a chair. It's not interested in grand entrances. Pay attention or you may miss its quiet arrival.

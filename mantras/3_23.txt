Stop what you're doing and look around you. What do you see ? What do you hear ? What do you feel ? There are so many things surroundings us that we take for granted, that we fail to be inspired by. In everything there is a bit of magic, a bit of sparkle that can enthuse you if you view it in the right light. Inspiration is everywhere. Look around.

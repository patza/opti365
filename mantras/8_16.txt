Beauty-- and the identification of it-- is unique. What you find beautiful, others might not. It's okay to have differing opinions when it comes to beauty. In fact, it's a wonderful thing that two people can have completely distinct ideas of what is beautiful. There is beauty in opinions-- and there's even more beauty in accepting what others find beautiful. Even if you don't see beauty right away, keep an open mind. You never know when your perspective might shift.
